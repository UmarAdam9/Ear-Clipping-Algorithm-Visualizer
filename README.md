Left clicking on the screen creates a vertex.

Press enter after placing the vertices to fill the polygon with triangles.

============# Important Notes #==================

The shapes you create must have an anticlockwise winding order otherwise the algorithm will not work properly.

Sometimes you might double click a point and create two vertices at the exact same position- this will also cause the algorithm to break.
To mitigate this problem , i've added a vertex counter on the top right, make sure that the vertex counter is equal to the number of distinct vertices on the canvas and you should be good.

Thats it!
